                question: "What does a snow blower do?",
                answer:
                  "Cub Cadet® snow blowers are engineered to quickly remove snow from unwanted areas. A single stage snow blower is the most basic kind, where the auger paddle pulls snow into the machine and throws it out of the chute. More advanced stages are designed to handle more snow.",

                question:
                  "What is the best type of snow blower for a driveway?",
                answer:
                  'There’s no one size fits all snow blower. Cub Cadet has models ideal for up to 6-in, 12-in, and 18-in. of snowfall, so take stock of how much snow is expected in your area to zero in on a category.

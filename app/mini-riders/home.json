			"question": "Can you use a riding mower on a small yard?",
			"answer": "A small riding lawn mower can significantly speed up the mowing process compared to a standard 21-in. push mower. The 30-inch cutting width vs. a standard 21-in. walk-behind deck helps provide more ground coverage per pass thus improving productivity and making the maintenance of your small yard manageable.
